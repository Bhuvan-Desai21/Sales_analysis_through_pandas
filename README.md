# This Project was made on jupyter Notebook
## it contains some cool data analysis of sales data of a company operating in US
## Some things included are:
- Data cleaning: First had to get rid of NaN values and also after combining the 12 months data in single there were many irregularities, so had to touch up.
- Graph of Month wise sales data: Had to extract the month number from the order date for each product and then group them together and finally plot it against total sales
- City wise sales data: Extracted the City name and also the state name from the purchase address, and plotted a graph showing which city had the best and wrost sales for the company
- Best time of sale: extracted the time of purchase from every order to figure out peak sale time and low sale time
- Most bought together products: user mostly orders things together so extracted which items were mostly bought together and graphed them up with no of times the products were bought together
