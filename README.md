# This Project was made on jupyter Notebook
## it contains some cool data analysis of sales data of a company operating in US
## Some things included are:
- Data cleaning: First had to get rid of NaN values and also after combining the 12 months data in single there were many irregularities, so had to touch up.
- Graph of Month wise sales data: Had to extract the month number from the order date for each product and then group them together and finally plot it against total sales
